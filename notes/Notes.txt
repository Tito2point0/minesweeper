To Dos:
    - Make a SQL database for storing high scores using knex.js
        - To find IP address of system:
            - $.getJSON("http://jsonip.com/?callback=?", function (data) {
                console.log(data);
                alert(data.ip);
              });
        - Only one username can belong to each system. IP address can be repeated, but username must be tied to IP address
            - Make helper function that takes in username from form and checks it against existing usernames
                - If username already exists:
                    - If IP attached to that username is the IP of the computer, allow username to be recorded
                    - If IP attached to that username is NOT the IP of the computer, present error message
    - Create and wire the API
    - List out all models needed, along with custom middleware and routers
    - Select from the list how to do the difficulty selection:
        - Keep the original Route setup
        - Fix the header issue in Home.js
        - Put a Gamemodes link in the hamburger menu
        - Create custom links via span and href for difficulty selection
    - Need to fix the CSS placement issue of the hamburger menu
    - Maybe pick a new color palatte?
    - Create a file or function for time recording (time played)
    - Create a function for marking number of bombs unselected
    - Create a function for detection of face change:
        - Default: happy
        - On keypress: shocked
        - On death: dead
    - Create a detection function for each square to search around it and find if there are any bombs connected to it. If there are, have the
      square state the number of bombs that it is touching
    - Create a detection function for keypresses:
        - Selecting a square with no bombs around it --> Expose every square around that one until it hits a square that is border a bomb
        - Selecting a square with a bomb bordering it --> Only that square flips up
        - Selecting a square with a bomb beneath it --> Death function gets called
    - Create a function that pulls from the api the high scores -- maybe using .map to record names and flexbox for recording hard, medium, and
      easy difficulty high scores
        - SQL query for returning highscore chart:
            - SELECT u.name, g.time, d.difficulty
              FROM username AS u
              LEFT JOIN gamemode AS g ON u.gamemode_id = g.gamemode_id
              LEFT JOIN difficulty AS d ON g.difficulty_id = d.difficulty_id
              ORDER BY g.time; 
        - Corresponding knex command:
            - db('username as u')
                .leftJoin('gamemode as g', 'u.gamemode_id', 'g.gamemode_id')
                .leftJoin('difficulty as d', 'g.difficulty_id', 'd.difficulty_id')
                .select('u.name', 'g.time', 'd.difficulty')
                .orderBy('g.time')
    - Create a Form.js file for making the custom board and if a highscore, the name of the player
        - Make a validation function for form data in the api. URL maybe :9000/api/board/custom?
    - Make sure to include false selects (square is selected but there is no bomb there) in set state
    - Maybe original state be something like this?
        - const initialState = {
            face: 'happy',
            bombsLeft: bombDifficulty,
            falseSelects: 0,
        }
        - { state, setState } = useState(initialState)
    - Create a variable, playing, that holds a value of true or false
        - playing === true: game is actively going
        - playing === false: changed when bomb is pressed and altered when new game starts

        - Pass this variable to TimeElapsed.js so that the while statement will break when playing stops, thus stopping the time
    - On click of happy or dead face, button should be pressed down with happy face and new board made

    - Maybe do something like this in about for instructions, or make an instructions tab?
